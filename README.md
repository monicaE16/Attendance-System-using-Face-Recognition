# Attendance System

An attendace system with custom implementation of face detection and face recognition algorithms.

This is CMPN446- Image Processing and Computer Vision course project - Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University.

## Implementation

- HOG with SVM are used for face detection.
- Face recognition is done using PCA to extract eigen faces, then SVM is used for classification.

## To use this code

To install needed packages use:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To start the app use:
```sh
python mainwindow.py
```
